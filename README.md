# Java-Practice-Projects

This is a collection of simple Java programs that I've built after completing the Java Udemy course, 
to consolidate all I've learn and build my Java skills.

## 1. Investment Earnings
This is a simple Java program that calculates profits or loss on investments per day. It accepts a 'buying price'
and 'investment closing price' from the user, and uses it to calculate the profits/loss. 
NOTE: The program will continue until the 'investment closing price' inputed is less than 0.0

## 2. Budget Allocation
This is a simple budgeting program that allocates money based on the 'total spending money' and 'percentage proportion'
inputed by the user. Since the program does not know how many 'percentage proportions' will be inputed, it uses
an ArrayList to store the inputs. The 'percentage porportions' inputed are used to allocate the 'total spending money'.
NOTE: The program will accept 'percentage proportions' until the total sum of inputs exceeds 100%. Afterwards, it will
recalculate the last input, to ensure the sum is exactly 100.
